Here is your homework for week 1

1) Make sure you are able to watch the class recording. You can find the class recording
on the general chat. If you are not able to watch the recording then please let the teacher
know next class.

2) Make sure you saved/bookmarked the link to the class website. 

3) Make sure you saved/bookmarked the link to your progress report

4) The final thing you have to do is find me on Microsoft Teams and send me a private message
   saying that your finished the homework. Note you only have to do this for week 1. I am doing
   this so you know how to get in touch with the teacher if you ever need help.

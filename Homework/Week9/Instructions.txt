Question 2
Write Python code to process a list of numbers and removes all numbers from the list 
that are less than 50 or greater than 85. At the end you should print out the new list.


Question 3
Write Python code that takes a string and removes all punctuation and special characters from it and print the new string.
To help you, here is a list of all the punctuation and special characters that you need to worry about
punctuation_and_special = [".", "," , ":", ";", "!", "?", "$", "@", "%", "#"]

For exmaple if the string is like this
my_string = "Hello, My name is $John? and I love CS!!"

then you code needs to remove all the punctuation and special character so that in the end the string looks like this...
"Hello My name is John and I love CS"

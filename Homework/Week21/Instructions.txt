Ok next week we are going to work on a project (a game) and you will need to use everything
you have learned so far. Do not worry it will be easy and we will work through it together.
Before next week I need to make sure your programming skills are up to date so please answers the
following questions. Please remember to save your work as you will be handing it in to me next
week. 

1) What is the difference between "if" "elif" and "else"?


2) What is a logical operator and what are two examples?


3) How many if statements are there in the code given directly below and what does it print?
---- Code start ----
x = 10
y = 20
z = 1

if x > y:
  print("Hello")
elif y < 5:
  print("yo")

if y > 89:
  x = x + 10
else:
  y = 0

print(x - z)
print(y + z)
---- Code End ----

4) Here is a Python List ---> my_list = [6, 4, 2, 8, 10, 0]
Which number is at index 3?
Which number is at index 7? (Is it even possible? Why or why not)
What does my_list.append(100) do?
What does my_list[0] = 20 do?


5) What are the two main types of loops?


6) What does the following code print?
---- Code start ----
x = [50, 100, 150]
y = [70, 80, 600]

for index in range(0, len(x)):
   print("I am a circle and my position is ...")
   print(x[index])
   print(y[index])
---- Code End ----

7) When drawing a circle we use the ellipse command. Here is an example --> ellipse(10, 20, 50, 50).
What do the first two numbers represent? What do the last two numbers represent?


8) Write some code in Processing that draws a blue rectangle at the center of the output screen and
four green circles at each of the four corners. The output screen should be 900 by 900 and the background
must be black. Hint: you will need def setup(): and def draw():

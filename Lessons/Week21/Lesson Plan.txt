Here is the homework from week 20 we will take it up today in week 21

Part 1:
In Processing make a program of two balls moving up and down that bounce off the top and bottom
walls. You can decide on the size of the balls and even the color. Try to make sure that the balls
are always moving in the opposite direction. HINT: Look back at the code covered in class

Part 2:
Once you got part 1 finished you now need to add extra code so that when you click on the "A" key
on your keyboard a ball disappears. For example, the first time you click "A" one of the two balls
will disapear. Then the second time you click "A" the second ball disappears. At this point you will
have no more balls. HINT: use def keyPressed(): and do not forget the pre made variable key 

Part 3 Bonus (You do not have to do this, but I recommend you do it):
Add even more code so that each time you click on your mouse the color of the background changes.


If we have time we will discuss raycasting and projectiles

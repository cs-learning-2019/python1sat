We will now begin another major project.
We will make a simple 2D shooting game called "Shoot them circles"
In class I will write some code and explain the structure.
For homework you will be ask to fill in some missing parts and code new parts yourself.
So make sure you pay attention in class.

BTW lets see the finish product that you guys will attempt to create.
